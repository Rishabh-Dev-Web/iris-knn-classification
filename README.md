# Iris Dataset KNN Classification

This project uses the Iris dataset to train and evaluate a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model with varying `k` values.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Correlation analysis
- Train-test split (80/20)
- KNN model training with k = 1, 3, 5, 7
- Accuracy evaluation & classification report
- Confusion matrix visualization

## Best Model
- **Best k**: 3
- **Accuracy**: 1.0 (on test set)

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
